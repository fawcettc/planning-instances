;;; collection world test case 2
;;;  Now things are a little more complicated:  there are
;;;  still two glasses at N-0-0 along with a broken glass
;;;  consumer, but the only way to dispose of an unbroken glass
;;;  is at N-0-1, and the road between them is bumpy.  Also there is no bomb
;;;  at N-0-0, but there is one at N-0-1.   So there is an obvious best
;;;  plan:  take both of the glasses over the bumpy road with a box and
;;;  dispose of them at N-0-1, but there are many other options that your
;;;  planner might get stuck on.   Notice that there's an additional
;;;  flag to this world indicating whether you want to think about
;;;  paying toll.  So your actual call to start simulator will be
;;;  '(make-test-world-two :toll t) or :toll nil
;;; I use the tolled option (R1 is tolled)
