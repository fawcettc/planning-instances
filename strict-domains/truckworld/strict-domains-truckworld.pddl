;;; Truckworld domain
;;;   Hanks' truckworld simulation world (simplfied)
;;;   Also demonstrates some search control written in lisp/ranking function,
;;;   not scr.
;;;
;;;   I've put some effort into reducing number of open conditions
;;;   by using some implicit axioms (not ucpop's axioms)
;;;   For example,  (holding ?x) means (liftable ?x) [not the other way though]
;;; I've tried to minimize the # of simplifying assumptions.
;;; The only ones are:
;;; medium truck speed (see comments in travel operator)
;;; get money at most once
;;;   I don't think this is simplifying at all though.  Think of the
;;;   truck which will look at the plan (which is the purpose of planning
;;;   really),  and it can decide how much $$ it needs.  It will not,
;;;   because of this relaxation,  do stupid things like spending money all
;;;   over the place.  This is because if you spend money you'll get more
;;;   steps and thus the plan is not as good as others.  Moreover,  my
;;;   truck does not get any money if it doesn't need any.
;;; get fuel from dispenser at most once
;;;   Similar reasoning as money.  I think it suffice to ask the truck to
;;;   refuel itself if needed.
;;; unlimited hand capacity
;;;   UCPOP doesn't handle quantity in any reasonably easy way, just look
;;;   at how messy it is for fuel.  I think it's a responsibility of the
;;;   execution system to do tasks like dispose of the fuel drum.  Also I
;;;   think these details should be part of a hierchical system and
;;;   abstract out.
