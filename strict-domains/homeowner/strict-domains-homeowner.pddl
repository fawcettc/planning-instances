;; Here lies an encoding of Pednault's IJCAI-91 example
;;
;;  You bought a house and discover that after turning on water,
;;  it pours out of holes in the wall.  Using the three actions from
;;  below, the homeowner's problem is to find a way to have the water
;;  on without having all those holes in the wall.
;;
;;  1) A "Fixing the wall" action is only effective when the
;;     plumbing is good.
;;  2) A "Fixing the plumbing" action is only good when the water
;;     is off.
;;  2) A "Turning the faucet" action will bash the wall only
;;     when the plumbing is bad and when you turn it to "ON".
;;
;;  The first two actions are encoded as (FIX ?it).
;;  The second is (TURN-FAUCET ?how).
;;
